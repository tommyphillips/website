    <h1>Computer Science Self Study</h1>
    <h3>My journey to computer science and technology</h3>
    <p> As a child, my family and friends hadno interest or knowledge of computers, 
        and I felt no compulsion to spend my free time learning and playing with computers.     
        I couldn't see the point of all that.
    </p>
    <p> Although I didn't know anyone who was interested in computers, I did have a lot in common with the people who were. 
        I was interested in detail and in understanding how things really work.
        That was why I enjoyed mathematics and sciences. 
        I liked to understand <em>exactly</em> how things worked.  
        This caused me to struggle to engage with the typical online 'Intro to HTML' style courses.
        I couldn't see how or why the code I typed was having its effect. 
        It was all a mystery, and the explanations were not telling me how it really worked.
        Of course, how a piece of code has its affect on the computer is a rather complicated thing.
        That is why we use abstraction; to enable us to take some things as given, and build upon them.
        Perhaps if I had grasped that computing was all about abstraction, 
        and I didn't need to know everything, I could have stuck at it.
        But I was enjoying my childhood, and playing sports, and computing was not something I knew about. 
    </p>
    <p> My undergraduate degree was in Mathematics, Operational Research, Statistics and Economics at Warwick University.
        During that time, I suppose we verged onto some computational and algorithmic topics in certain modules, but nothing
        really significant. We also used LaTeX and R at times, but most students (including myself) got by while only knowing 
        the bare minimum about these tools. By the time I graduated, I still knew almost nothing about programming,
        but things would not stay that way for long.
    </p>
    <p> Immediately after graduating from Warwick, I went to Hong Kong to do an internship with Jane Street, a quantitative market-making 
        company. It was there that I had my first exposure to not just technology, but people who were good at technology.
        This was an eye-opening experience for me, and I was particularly impressed by one of my fellow interns and what he could do.
        I realised that I was missing out on something, and so I decided to change that. It won't be easy to catch
        up with (and hopefully go beyond) the people who had been into this stuff since they were kids.
        But so far in life, I have found myself able to excel at anything that I truly set my mind to.
        Hopefully this will be no different.
        My mathematical/statistical background is decent preparation for the task,
        and will hugely complement the computing skills I develop.
